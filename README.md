# Notice for this i18n edition of MarkText

This MarkText fork has i18n support powered by `vue-i18n`. Configuration files consent to its standard.

Full Simplified Chinese translation is available.

**NOTICE:** Since MarkText is actively maintained, patches introduced with my fork cannot be simply applied to upstream. New features are not synced here as well. **Use at your own risk!**
